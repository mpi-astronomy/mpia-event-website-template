## Accessibility

HdA is accessible to disabled persons, and dedicated parking spaces are available. Unfortunately, the buses dedicated to the event and public transportations may not be accessible for everyone. However, there are specific taxi services in Heidelberg that we can arrange on-demand. Don't hesitate to contact us if you need any assistance or have any questions.

Note that mobile phone connectivity at/around the HdA is at best poor but usually non-existent.
