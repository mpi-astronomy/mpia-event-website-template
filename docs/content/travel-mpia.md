## <i class="fa-solid fa-road-barrier"></i> Visa

You may need to apply for a visa to enter Germany. See this overview of [visa requirements](http://www.mpia.de/en/services/information-for-guests/before-arrival).

Feel free to contact the organizers if you need a letter of support.


## <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Travel restrictions

While travel is now possible, there are still many continuously changing restrictions. We'll do our best to provide support and information.

Entry to Germany is limited to nationals from EU member states, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland, and those vaccinated with [vaccines approved in Germany](https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/country/germany/). Exceptions are possible for [researchers and scientists](https://www-bmi-bund-de.translate.goog/SharedDocs/faqs/DE/themen/bevoelkerungsschutz/coronavirus/reisebeschraenkungen-grenzkontrollen/IV-reisebeschraenkungen-im-aussereuropaeischen-luft-und-seeverkehr-einreisen-aus-drittstaat/welche-fachkraefte-und-hoch-qualifizierte-arbeitnehmer-duerfen-einreisen.html?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp), but we recommend checking with your local German embassy to confirm if these apply to you. Travelers are obligated to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test and proof of vaccination or recovery upon entering the country. Additionally, MPIA and HdA are currently operating under 2G rules whereby only vaccinated (with a Germany-approved vaccine) or recovered individuals are allowed on the premises. We will continue to update this information, and please check with a German embassy for specific restrictions and visa requirements based on your location and citizenship.

## Getting to Heidelberg

### <i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i> Flight

We recommend flying to Frankfurt Airport (FRA), as this is the nearest international airport to Heidelberg. The following directions to Heidelberg assume that you are starting from Frankfurt.

Deutsche Bahn (DB) has connections from Frankfurt Airport (station: Frankfurt(M) Flughafen Fernbahnhof) to various train stations around Heidelberg (likely either Hauptbanhof or Altstadt, depending on where your hotel is). Typically you will take a train to Mannheim and change platforms there for the S-Bahn to Heidelberg. The total travel time is of the order of one hour.
Tickets cost about 25 € each way. The timetable is available [here](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml). You can buy a ticket in advance, but we don't recommend the cheaper "saver" tickets, as these apply to the specific booked train -- You cannot use them on a different train if you have flight delays.

The two best shuttle options are [Transfer & Limousine Service (TLS)](https://www.tls-heidelberg.de/en/) (40 € each way) and [Lufthansa Express Shuttle](https://www.lufthansa.com/de/en/Lufthansa-Express-Shuttle) (25 € each way).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-train"></i> Train

[Deutsche Bahn (DB)](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml) has connections to various train stations around Heidelberg (likely either Hauptbanhof or Altstadt, depending on where your hotel is). Typically you will have a connection in Mannheim and change platforms there for the S-Bahn to Heidelberg. [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/) could also help you plan your journey across multiple countries and train companies.

Although there are no barier gates in Germany, you will need to buy a ticket before stepping into the trains. The controls are frequent. You can buy tickets online or at ticket machines or for S-Bahn (and local buses) on the [eVRN app](https://www.vrn.de/service/apps/etarif/index.html).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-bus"></i> Bus

A cheaper but slower alternative is the "Flixbus" from the airport to Heidelberg. The prices range from 5 to 15 € each way, but depending on the time of day, the trip could take up to three hours due to stops and traffic. To investigate timetables and book tickets, you can check out the [Flixbus website](https://www.flixbus.com/).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-road"></i> Driving directions
If you decide to rent a car and drive, you can follow [these directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Frankfurt+Airport,+Frankfurt,+Germany/Max-Planck-Institut+f%C3%BCr+Astronomie,+K%C3%B6nigstuhl+17,+69117+Heidelberg/@49.7240731,8.3527948,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x47bd0b745442f979:0x8a74d84d21f8f331!2m2!1d8.5621518!2d50.0379326!1m5!1m1!1s0x4797c04e5257640d:0x7a5e759cc166d6bf!2m2!1d8.7236247!2d49.3968064!3e0) (to MPIA).


## Getting to HdA

There will be a shuttle to transport participants from the town center up the hill to MPIA/HdA every morning. It will leave from [Hotel NH](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+NH+Heidelberg/@49.407697,8.6806093,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!3m7!1s0x4797c1205993432d:0x92b8113bd142134d!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d49.407697!4d8.682798) on Bergheimer Strasse at 08:15 (bus/company name "discipulus"). It will then stop briefly to pick up at [Peterskirche](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Peterskirche/@49.4087233,8.7047502,17.85z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4797c103fc64910d:0xc8f660bad39fe450!8m2!3d49.408916!4d8.705417?hl=en) (the stop on the south side of the road, i.e., the one closest to the hill) at 08:20 (the bus might only arrive five minutes later here, but be there no later than 08:20 as the bus cannot wait). A local participant will be at each pick-up point and travel on the bus. A bus will bring participants back into town (the same two stops) after each day's workshop.

[<i class="fa-solid fa-route"></i> Workshop bus itinerary](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Hotel+NH+Heidelberg,+Bergheimer+Str.+91,+69115+Heidelberg/49.4089253,8.7051327/Max-Planck-Institut+f%C3%BCr+Astronomie,+K%C3%B6nigstuhl,+Heidelberg/@49.4049805,8.7016122,16.19z/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x4797c1205993432d:0x92b8113bd142134d!2m2!1d8.682798!2d49.407697!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x4797c04e5257640d:0x7a5e759cc166d6bf!2m2!1d8.7231418!2d49.3969229!3e0)

At other times of the day, you can take Bus 30 - the "Science Bus" - [up to MPIA](https://www.rnv-online.de/media/rnv-online.de/Fahrtinfo/Fahrplaene/Aushangfahrplaene_2020/02030P_1_01198_11.pdf) (the bus will drop you off right outside HdA) or [back down the hill](https://www.rnv-online.de/media/rnv-online.de/Fahrtinfo/Fahrplaene/Aushangfahrplaene_2020/02030P_2_01175_11.pdf) (you probably want to get off at [Peterskirche](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Peterskirche/@49.4089407,8.7040163,17.91z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4797c103fc64910d:0xc8f660bad39fe450!8m2!3d49.408916!4d8.705417)). A map of the entire bus/tram network is [here](https://www.rnv-online.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/Plaene/Liniennetzplaene/Liniennetzplan_HD.pdf) (the MPIA is slightly below and right of the center). You can buy tickets online or at ticket machines or (if that fails) from the driver on the bus (the cost is approximately 2.50 € each way) or on the [eVRN app](https://www.vrn.de/service/apps/etarif/index.html). Note that where the Science Bus departs - Universitätsplatz - to go up to MPIA is not far from Peterskirche. There is also a taxi stand near there if all else fails.

## <i class="fa-brands fa-wpexplorer"></i> Exploring Heidelberg

The easiest way to explore Heidelberg is by foot. The Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr (RNV) provides public transportation in Heidelberg with buses and trams; these can take you more or less anywhere you want to go within the city. The timetables can be found [online](https://www.rnv-online.de/fahrplaene.html); you can also download various apps to help you plan, e.g., the official RNV app (in german) or the [RNV Ticket app](https://www.rnv-online.de/tickets/tickets-kaufen/handy-ticket.html), and the [eVRN app](https://www.vrn.de/service/apps/etarif/index.html) (in English). Note that Google Maps can also provide bus schedules.
